These are a few pieces of Python code I wrote while working through online courses during the recent pandemic. 
ML_testing.py is essentially my notes from Cornell's Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems course, 
where I wrote and tested most of the algorithms used in the course from scratch. 
Pi_from_MonteCarlo.py was the result of a high school student that I tutored asking how digits of pi can be calculated,
so I made some simple code to calculate the first few digits using Monte Carlo methods.
